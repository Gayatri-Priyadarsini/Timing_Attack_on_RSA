RSA method uses squares and multiply operations. Since the pro-
cessor uses different amounts of electricity, hence time, for different
operations that include mathematical operations, one could deter-
mine the private key of the RSA by observing the time taken.
We decrypt the message using RSA by taking the Cipher and
raising it to the power of d. Here N is the multiplication of two
large prime numbers. The decryption key and encryption key are
(d,n) and (e,n) respectively.

It is also important to note that If we want to run a process
quickly, we need more amount of electricity in the wires and the
chip. If we have more amount of electricity in the chip and wires,
the device can emit more electromagnetic waves. It simply shows us
that attacks can be increased if we have speed chips in the devices.
